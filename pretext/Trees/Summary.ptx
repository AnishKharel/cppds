        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>In this chapter we have looked at the tree data structure. The tree data
            structure enables us to write many interesting algorithms. In this
            chapter we have looked at algorithms that use trees to do the following:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>A binary tree for parsing and evaluating expressions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A balanced binary tree (AVL tree).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A binary tree to implement a min heap.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A min heap used to implement a priority queue.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
