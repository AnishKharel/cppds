                <p>A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are
                    <math>O(n^{2})</math> algorithms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental
                    sublists. It falls between <math>O(n)</math> and <math>O(n^{2})</math>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A merge sort is <math>O(n \log n)</math>, but requires additional space
                    for the merging process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A quick sort is <math>O(n \log n)</math>, but may degrade to
                    <math>O(n^{2})</math> if the split points are not near the middle of the
                    list. It does not require additional space.</p>
