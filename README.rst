Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using C++
=============================================================

This book began in Python as the paper book, *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python*, first published by Franklin Beedle & Associates written by Brad Miller and David Ranum back in 2005.  We are all grateful for the vision of Jim Leisy who gave permission to take the original Python version of this text and freely publish it online as an interactive textbook.

The interactive version was then translated to C++ by Jan Pearce and a team of excellent Berea College students in the summer of 2018. This translation became this interactive text.
