Discussion Questions
--------------------

#. Using the hash table performance formulas given in the chapter,
   compute the average number of comparisons necessary when the table is

   -  10% full

   -  25% full

   -  50% full

   -  75% full

   -  90% full

   -  99% full

   At what point do you think the hash table is too small? Explain.

#. Modify the hash function for strings to use positional weightings.

#. We used a hash function for strings that weighted the characters by
   position. Devise an alternative weighting scheme. What are the biases
   that exist with these functions?

#. Research perfect hash functions. Using a list of names (classmates,
   family members, etc.), generate the hash values using the perfect
   hash algorithm.
