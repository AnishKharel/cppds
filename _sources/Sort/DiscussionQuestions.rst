Discussion Questions
--------------------

#. Generate a random list of integers. Show how this list is sorted by
   the following algorithms:

   -  bubble sort

   -  selection sort

   -  insertion sort

   -  shell sort (you decide on the increments)

   -  merge sort

   -  quick sort (you decide on the pivot value)

#. Consider the following list of integers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Show
   how this list is sorted by the following algorithms:

   -  bubble sort

   -  selection sort

   -  insertion sort

   -  shell sort (you decide on the increments)

   -  merge sort

   -  quick sort (you decide on the pivot value)

#. Consider the following list of integers: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. Show
   how this list is sorted by the following algorithms:

   -  bubble sort

   -  selection sort

   -  insertion sort

   -  shell sort (you decide on the increments)

   -  merge sort

   -  quick sort (you decide on the pivot value)

#. Consider the list of characters: [``'P','Y','T','H','O','N'``]. Show
   how this list is sorted using the following algorithms:

   -  bubble sort

   -  selection sort

   -  insertion sort

   -  shell sort (you decide on the increments)

   -  merge sort

   -  quick sort (you decide on the pivot value)

#. Devise alternative strategies for choosing the pivot value in quick
   sort. For example, pick the middle item. Re-implement the algorithm
   and then execute it on random data sets. Under what criteria does
   your new strategy perform better or worse than the strategy from this
   chapter?
